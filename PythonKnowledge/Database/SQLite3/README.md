# SQLite3 

SQLite3 is a lightweight and self-contained SQL database engine that comes built into Python. 

It is widely used for managing relational databases in small to medium-sized applications. 

Here's an overview of its uses:

What SQLite3 is for:

    Database management: Create, read, update, and delete data in relational databases with SQL queries.

    Lightweight applications: Perfect for local data storage in small projects, prototypes, or embedded systems.

    No server setup: SQLite3 doesn’t require a separate server process; the database is a single file stored locally.

    Integration with Python: Use Python's sqlite3 module to execute SQL queries and interact with databases directly.

    Compatibility: Works on multiple platforms and supports most SQL features like indexing, transactions, and joins.

SQLite3 in practice:

    Prototyping: Useful for quickly setting up a database without complex configurations.

    Local storage: Ideal for storing configuration data, logs, or small datasets.

    Testing: Can simulate database interactions in development before moving to larger database systems.

SQLite3 is simple, efficient, and reliable for projects that don’t require the scalability of full-fledged database management systems.
