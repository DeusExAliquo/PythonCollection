# AI & Data processing / Sklearn

Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a powerful and popular Python library for machine learning. It simplifies building, training, and evaluating machine learning models. Here are its main uses

Data preprocessing: cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data to prepare it (e.g., StandardScaler, PCA).

Classification: solving categorization problems (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors).

Regression: predicting continuous values (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso).

Clustering: grouping similar data without labels (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).

Dimensionality reduction: simplifying complex datasets while preserving information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).

Model evaluation: built-in metrics to measure performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

It is beginner-friendly while being robust enough for advanced projects.
