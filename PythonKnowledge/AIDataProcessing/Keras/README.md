# AI & Data processing / Keras

Keras is a high-level deep learning library that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying neural networks. 

It is now integrated into TensorFlow but can also be used independently with other backends. 

Here's an overview of its uses:

What Keras is for:

    Easy model building: Keras uses a clean, user-friendly API for quickly defining neural networks with layers like Dense, Conv2D, LSTM, etc.

    Customizability: While simple to use, it allows advanced users to create custom layers, loss functions, and metrics.

    Model training: Provides out-of-the-box support for training loops, optimizers, and callbacks (e.g., early stopping, learning rate schedulers).

    Integration: Works seamlessly with TensorFlow, enabling distributed training, GPU/TPU support, and deployment on various platforms.

    Pre-trained models: Offers pre-built architectures like ResNet, MobileNet, and BERT for transfer learning.

Keras in practice:

    Beginner-friendly: Great for those new to deep learning because of its intuitive API.
    
    Rapid prototyping: Ideal for testing ideas or building prototypes quickly.

    Production-ready: Easily integrates with TensorFlowâ€™s tools for deploying models on mobile, web, or edge devices.

Keras combines simplicity with flexibility, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users to build deep learning models efficiently.
