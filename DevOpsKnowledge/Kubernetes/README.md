# Devops / Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

It orchestrates containers across a cluster of machines, ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient resource usage. 

Here's an overview of its uses:

What Kubernetes (K8s) is for:

    Container orchestration: Manages the deployment and operation of containers across multiple nodes in a cluster.

    Scaling applications: Automatically scales applications up or down based on traffic or resource usage.

    High availability: Ensures containers are running and restarts them automatically if they fail.

    Load balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple instances of an application to optimize performance.

    Infrastructure abstraction: Provides a unified platform for managing containers, regardless of the underlying infrastructure 
    (cloud, on-premise, hybrid).
    
    Self-healing: Detects and replaces failed containers or nodes to maintain a healthy system.

Kubernetes (K8s) in practice:

    Microservices management: Ideal for running microservices, enabling seamless communication and scaling between services.
    
    CI/CD integration: Works with CI/CD pipelines to automate application deployment and updates.
    
    Hybrid cloud deployments: Simplifies managing workloads across on-premises and multiple cloud providers.
    
    Resource optimization: Allocates resources dynamically to ensure efficient use of CPU, memory, and storage.
    
    Rolling updates and rollbacks: Allows deploying new application versions without downtime and rolling back in case of issues.

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications in complex environments, offering reliability, scalability, and automation for modern cloud-native development.
