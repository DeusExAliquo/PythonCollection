# PythonCollection
## A collection of stuff I know in Python, cheatsheets and projects (I mostly have cheatsheets for now though)
### Everything will be organized in subjects and sub-subjects, every subjects should have their own readme as well, if I remember they should have at least.

#### AI & Data Processing (empty for now)

#### Database (empty for now)

#### WebScrapping (empty for now)
