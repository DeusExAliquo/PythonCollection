# DatabaseKnowledge
## A bunch of stuff I know about Databases with cheatsheets.
### Everything will be organized in subjects and sub-subjects, every subjects should have their own readme as well, if I remember they should have at least. For the databases with python check [Here](https://github.com/DeusExAliquo/Knowledge/tree/main/PythonKnowledge/Database)

#### [SQL](https://github.com/DeusExAliquo/Knowledge/tree/main/DatabaseKnowledge/SQL)

#### [NoSQL](https://github.com/DeusExAliquo/Knowledge/tree/main/DatabaseKnowledge/NoSQL)

### [A long doc about the difference between SQL and No-SQL and which should you choose for a project](https://www.ml4devs.com/articles/datastore-choices-sql-vs-nosql-database/)
